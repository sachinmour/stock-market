### Basejump: Chart the Stock Market

#### USER STORIES:

1. I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

2. I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

3. I can remove stocks.

4. I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
